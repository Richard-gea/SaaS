Problem:
Tourists struggle to find restaurant menus  based on their exact location. Many restaurants don’t have updated menus online, making it hard for visitors to decide where to eat.

Solution:
A micro-SaaS app that shows tourists nearby restaurants and automatically provides menus based on location. Restaurants can update their menus easily through the platform, ensuring accuracy.

Target Audience:

Tourists visiting new cities

Restaurants in tourist-heavy areas

Small/local businesses that don’t have their own apps or websites

Pricing Idea:


Free plan → limited menu uploads

$19/month → unlimited menus, location targeting, featured listing

$49/month → advanced analytics (views, clicks, top dishes), premium visibility


🌐 Landing Page (simple MVP)

Built with Flutter (web) and MongoDB backend (later, for restaurant data).

For now, just a static landing page with:

“Coming soon” signup form (email collection).
